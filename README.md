# CovidSurg

COVIDSurg Collaborative is led by the NIHR Global Surgery Research Unit. This machine learning risk stratification tool has been developed with the Health Data Research UK (HDRUK) team at the Institute of Translational Medicine, hosted within the University of Birmingham. The risk calculator is based upon data from patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 within the 7-days before to 30-days after surgery (perioperative infection). Patients underwent surgery of all types and for any indication during the COVID-19 pandemic (February 2020 to July 2020). The link to the study protocol is available at: https://globalsurg.org/covidsurg/ .A machine learning technique was used to generate the CovidSurg Risk calculator and has the potential to inform surgeons, patients, and healthcare decision makers to reach a better understanding of risk when treating surgical patients during the COVID-19 pandemic

Data is available upon reasonable request, and the code containd an.Rmd example of what the results look like. 

It is based on the drake library and so after downloading all the packages found in CovidSUrgPackages, just running the main file CovidSurg yields the results.
